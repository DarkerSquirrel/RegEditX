# RegEditX (Registry Editor X)

Enhanced registry editor (work in progress). Notable improvements over the standard RegEdit:

* Undo / redo support
* Read only mode to prevent accidental changes
* Keys visible in list view (optional)
* Real registry view, not just the normal one
* Four view types in list view
* Last write time shown for keys
* Better icons :) (icons by Axialis <http://www.axialis.com>)
